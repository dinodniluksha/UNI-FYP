34588464,Python: how to capture image from webcam on click using OpenCV,"<p>I want to capture and save a number of images from my webcam using OpenCV. This is my code currently:</p>

<pre><code>import cv2

camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
for i in range(10):
    return_value, image = camera.read()
    cv2.imwrite('opencv'+str(i)+'.png', image)
del(camera)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that I do not know when the images are being taken, so a lot of them end up blurry. My question is: <strong>Is there a way to have the image taken on the click of a keyboard key?</strong> </p>

<p>Also is there a better way to take multiple images, instead of range?</p>
